# Statistics Practice Questions

## Combinatorics / counting questions

## Dice questions

### What is the most likely outcome if you roll two dice and take their sum?

Here are two ways to intuite the answer:

(1) Using statistics, we know that, in expectation, the mean outcome of a given die is 3.5. So, the mean outcome of two dice, since they're independent variables, is 3.5 + 3.5 = 7. 

(2) Using reasoning, we can reason that 7 should be the answer. Let's say that the answer is something above 7. Take 8 for example. If we roll a 1 on the first die, we already cannot get 8 as a sum. Therefore, for 8 and above, there's a possibility that, based off our first roll, we can't get the desired sum. If we take the numbers below 7, the same holds true. For example, if we want a sum of 6, then if we roll a 6 on the first die we already can't get 6 in total. The only sum where it's still possible to get that outcome regardless of what you roll on the first die is 7. 

### How would you determine if a die was unfair?

The standard approach would be to use a chi-squared test. You want to determine the degree of confidence that you'd like in your answers, and then use a chi-squared test to determine the number of rolls that you'd need to determine, with a certain degree of confidence, if the die was unfair.

## Coin questions

### How would you determine if a coin was unfair?

You can use a binomial test (which is just using the binomial distribution formula): https://www.spss-tutorials.com/binomial-test/

Here's the equation for the binomial distribution:

### If you have a biased coin, how could you simulate an unbiased coin?

### There is a fair coin (one side heads, one side tails) and an unfair coin (both sides tails). You pick one at random, flip it 5 times, and observe that it comes up as tails all five times. What is the chance that you are flipping the unfair coin?

This involves Bayesian probability. 

What you want is P(Unfair | 5 tails), and to solve for that, what you can do is:

P(Unfair | 5 tails) = [P(5 tails | Unfair) * P(Unfair)] / P(5 tails).

P(5 tails) = P(5 tails | Fair)P(Fair) + P(5 tails | Unfair)P(Unfair)

Plugging these in, you get 32/33 as your answer, or about 97%. 

### What is the expected number of coin flips needed to get two consecutive heads?

Let X be the result of getting 2 heads. 

Let's say that you flip the coin once. Then:

E[X] = (1/2)(1 + E[X|H]) + (1/2)(1 + E[X|T])

We know that E[X|T] = E[X], since we'd just have to start over from scratch.

Now, let's solve for E[X|H]. Just like with E[X], let's split up E[X|H] into its two possible outcomes:

E[X|H] = (1/2)(1 + E[X|HH]) + (1/2)(1 + E[X|HT])

We know that E[X|HH] = 0 (we're done, we got two heads in a row), and we also know that E[X|HT] = E[X] (since we'd have to start from scratch. Plugging those into E[X|H], we get:

E[X|H] = (1/2)(1 + 0) + (1/2)(1 + E[X]) = 1 + (1/2)E[X]

Plugging E[X|H] into our equation for E[X]:

E[X] = (1/2)(1 + E[X|H]) + (1/2)(1 + E[X|T]). 

Now, let's plug in E[X|H] = 1 + (1/2)E[X] and E[X|T] = E[X]:

E[X] = (1/2)(1 + 1 + (1/2)E[X]) + (1/2)(1 + E[X]) = 1 + (1/4)E[X] + (1/2) + (1/2)E[X] = (3/2) + (3/4)E[X]

Now, we have the following:

E[X] = (3/2) + (3/4)E[X]

Solving for E[X], we get E[X] = 6

### A and B are playing a game where A has n+1 coins, B has n coins, and they each flip all of their coins. What is the probability that A will have more heads than B?

Source: https://www.nicksingh.com/posts/40-probability-statistics-data-science-interview-questions-asked-by-fang-wall-street

Let's start with what could happen after the first "n" tosses. After "n" tosses, there are 3 possibilities:

1. A has more heads than B
2. A and B have the same number of heads
3. A has less heads than B

In scenario 1, A will always win (since they've already got more heads than B) and in scenario 3, A will always lose (since even if they get heads on the next toss, they won't have more heads than B). By symmetry, P(Event 1) = P(Event 3). So, let's set X = P(Event 1) = P(Event 3). Now, let's set y = P(Event 2). Since these are the only three possible scenarios, we know that:

P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) + P(Event 3) = 1

X + Y + X = 1

2X + Y = 1

So, Y = 1-2X. 

Now, we know that in half of the times that Event 2 happens, A will win, since in half of the circumstances they'll get heads. As a result, the probability thatA wins is denoted by:

P(Event 1) + (1/2)P(Event 2) = X + (1/2)Y = X + (1/2)(1 - 2X) = X + 1/2 - X = 1/2

So, the probability that A wins is 1/2. 

###  A person flips an unbiased coin over and over again. Player A looks for the sequence HHT and player B looks for the sequence HTT. What is the probability that player A encounters their sequence first?

Let's take event A as the event where we see HHT before HTT. 

So, let's toss the coin once and see what we get:

P(A) = (1/2)P(A|H) + (1/2)P(A|T)

Since a T on the first toss means that we can't get HHT or HTT, it's the equivalent of having to restart. Rewriting our equation, we get:

P(A) = (1/2)P(A|H) + (1/2)P(A) => (1/2)P(A) = (1/2)P(A|H), or P(A) = P(A|H). 

Now, we only have to solve for P(A|H). Let's do conditioning on the second toss now. 

P(A|H) = (1/2)P(A|HH) + (1/2)P(A|HT)

Let's take a look at P(A|HH):

If we have P(A|HH), then to get HHT you need 1 T while to get HTT you need 2 Ts. So, it's impossible to get HTT without getting HHT first. Therefore, P(A|HH) = 1. 

Now, let's take a look at P(A|HT):

P(A|HT) = (1/2)P(A|HTH) + (1/2)P(A|HTT). 

Looking at P(A|HTT), A already loses (since we see HTT before HHT), so P(A|HTT) = 0
Looking at P(A|HTH), this is the same as having to start over with one H, so P(A|HTH) = P(A|H). 

Therefore, P(A|HT) = (1/2)P(A|H) + 0

Now, plugging that into our equation above:

P(A|H) = (1/2)(1) + (1/2)( (1/2)P(A|H) ) = (1/2) + (1/4)P(A|H)

P(A|H) = (1/2) + (1/4)P(A|H) = P(A) ==> (3/4)P(A|H) = (1/2), or P(A|H) = 2/3 = P(A)

Therefore, the probability of seeing HHT before HTT is 2/3.
