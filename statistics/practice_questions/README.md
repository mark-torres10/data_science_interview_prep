# Statistics Practice Questions

## Combinatorics / counting questions

## Dice questions

### What is the most likely outcome if you roll two dice and take their sum?

Here are two ways to intuite the answer:

(1) Using statistics, we know that, in expectation, the mean outcome of a given die is 3.5. So, the mean outcome of two dice, since they're independent variables, is 3.5 + 3.5 = 7. 

(2) Using reasoning, we can reason that 7 should be the answer. Let's say that the answer is something above 7. Take 8 for example. If we roll a 1 on the first die, we already cannot get 8 as a sum. Therefore, for 8 and above, there's a possibility that, based off our first roll, we can't get the desired sum. If we take the numbers below 7, the same holds true. For example, if we want a sum of 6, then if we roll a 6 on the first die we already can't get 6 in total. The only sum where it's still possible to get that outcome regardless of what you roll on the first die is 7. 

### How would you determine if a die was unfair?
 
## Coin questions

### How would you determine if a coin was unfair?

### If you have a biased coin, how could you simulate an unbiased coin?

### There is a fair coin (one side heads, one side tails) and an unfair coin (both sides tails). You pick one at random, flip it 5 times, and observe that it comes up as tails all five times. What is the chance that you are flipping the unfair coin?

### A and B are playing a game where A has n+1 coins, B has n coins, and they each flip all of their coins. What is the probability that A will have more heads than B?

## Card questions

## Probability questions

## Pure statistics

### Say you are running a multiple linear regression and believe there are several predictors that are correlated. How will the results of the regression be affected if they are indeed correlated? How would you deal with this problem?
