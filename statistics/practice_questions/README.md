### What is the most likely outcome if you roll two dice and take their sum?

Here are two ways to intuite the answer:

(1) Using statistics, we know that, in expectation, the mean outcome of a given die is 3.5. So, the mean outcome of two dice, since they're independent variables, is 3.5 + 3.5 = 7. 

(2) Using reasoning, we can reason that 7 should be the answer. Let's say that the answer is something above 7. Take 8 for example. If we roll a 1 on the first die, we already cannot get 8 as a sum. Therefore, for 8 and above, there's a possibility that, based off our first roll, we can't get the desired sum. If we take the numbers below 7, the same holds true. For example, if we want a sum of 6, then if we roll a 6 on the first die we already can't get 6 in total. The only sum where it's still possible to get that outcome regardless of what you roll on the first die is 7.
